Title: Fishing for Treasure! 
 
Tagline: Mikey went to the sea to catch some big ones, but along the way he found something better.  
 
Story: Join Mikey as he enters the Big Sea Fishing challenge, competing against the best fishermen around the world.  
 
Genre: Sports 
 
Goal: Catch the biggest fish you can. The deeper you get, the bigger and faster the fish are. And at the bottom is a surprise. 
 
Basic Mechanics: The hook sinks at a constant rate from the surface and you can move it left and right. Fish move horizontally independently and the first fish you run into with the hook is the fish you attempt to catch. Try to avoid fish to get to deeper depths where larger fish are. The fish's move speed has a linear relationship with their size, so the larger the fish is, the faster it will move, making it more difficult to reach deeper depths. If you make it to the bottom of the sea, there is a treasure chest.  

After touching the fish with the hook, the game switches modes to a different minigame, with the goal of securing the catch. This again requires moving left and right, which will rotate the fishing reel counterclockwise and clockwise. The fish will give indications on which movements are required. Winding the reel the wrong way for a long enough duration will cause the fish to escape, while successfully winding it for a period will capture the fish. This duration will have a linear relationship with the fish size as well. 
 
Different modes: While both modes require the use of the left and right key, the first stage is similar to games such as fall down or tunnel, where you want to avoid obstacles to get further in the stage. After catching a fish, the second mode is more of a reaction type game, where the fish will give visual indicators on which way is required to reel. Precise timing and quick reactions are required in order to have success. 

There may be other competitors who will catch randomly sized fish within different ranges. You beat them by having a larger sized fish than them, and you place first in the competition automatically if you get the treasure.
