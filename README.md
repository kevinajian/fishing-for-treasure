Title: Fishing for Treasure! 
 
Story: You went to the sea to catch some big ones in the Big Sea Fishing Challenge. Try your best as you compete against the top fishermen in the world.
 
Genre: Sports 
 
Goal: Catch the biggest fish you can. The longer you last, the greater depth you reach, and the faster the fish move, making them harder to avoid. Also, the greather depth you reach, the heavier the fish weigh, making them harder to reel in and easier to escape from you.

Basic Mechanics: In the first mode, you can move the hook left and right, and it sinks at a constant rate. The fish move left and right, and the first fish you run into with the hook is the fish you attempt to catch in the second mode. Try to avoid fish to get to deeper depths where the larger fish are. Also, boots will randomly appear. If you hit a boot, you lose your bait and don't catch anything, losing the game.

After touching the fish with the hook, the game switches modes to the second mode, with the goal of securing the catch by reeling it in. The fish will move away from the hook, and will randomly move left and right. You reel the fish in by using the arrow keys to match the fish's left and right orientation, and press the space bar rapidly to pull the fish in.

Different modes: While both modes require the use of the left and right key, the first stage is similar to games such as fall down or tunnel, where you want to avoid obstacles to get further in the stage. After catching a fish, the second mode is more of a reaction type game, where the fish will give visual indicators on which way is required to reel. Precise timing and quick reactions are required in order to have success.
