Title: Fishing for Treasure! 
 
Story: Mikey went to the sea to catch some big ones in the Big Sea Fishing challenge. Join Mikey as he competes against the best fishermen in the world.
 
Genre: Sports 
 
Goal: Catch the biggest fish you can. The longer you last, the bigger and faster the fish are, making the catch worth more.

Basic Mechanics: You can move the hook left and right, and sinks at a constant rate. The fish move towards the hook, and the first fish you run into with the hook is the fish you attempt to catch. Try to avoid fish to get to deeper depths where the larger fish are.

After touching the fish with the hook, the game switches modes to the second mode, with the goal of securing the catch. The fish will move away from the hook, and will randomly move left and right. You can spin the reel left and right as well while constantly pressing space, and reeling in direction of the fish will pull the fish towards Mikey.
 
Different modes: While both modes require the use of the left and right key, the first stage is similar to games such as fall down or tunnel, where you want to avoid obstacles to get further in the stage. After catching a fish, the second mode is more of a reaction type game, where the fish will give visual indicators on which way is required to reel. Precise timing and quick reactions are required in order to have success.
